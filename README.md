# Kerbal Space Sync
Actually it is not possible to sync data between multiple instances of KSP.
With this Powershellscript, it's now possible!

# How it works
This script will detect our DropBox installation and path and copies all folder of KSP (GameData/Saves) into choosable foldern within your Dropbox. All files of your KSP folder will be deleted. Now this script creates some symbolic links to these folders with references into your dropbox. Only edit this script to your needs

# Tested systems
